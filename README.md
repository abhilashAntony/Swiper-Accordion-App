# ServerControl

## Introduction

This updated version of the app replaces the accordion with a slider, implemented using the [Swiper](https://swiperjs.com/) package. This allows the expansion panels to be displayed on a single page, rather than one below the other in the accordion.

## Installation

Have [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/) installed globally. All the dependencies used for this application are managed by [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/). Run `npm install` to install all the required dependencies. Run `ng serve` to start the application. Open the browser, and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
